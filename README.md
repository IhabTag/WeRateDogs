# We Rate Dogs - Data Wrangling


## Introduction

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Here, the main goal is to wrangle **WeRateDogs** Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. Using Python and its libraries, I have gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, and then cleaned it under the data wrangling process.

Here, with documenting my wrangling efforts, I have also showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).

The dataset that I have wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because ["they're good dogs Brent."](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent) WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
